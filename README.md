# Tyler Harris

**Hello!**  
I'm a **full-time student** with a passion for technology and continuous learning. While my GitHub might currently showcase a limited number of projects, I am actively working on growing my skills in a number of areas including machine learning, software devolopment, and network solutions.

Currently, I am exploring:
- TinyML
- WiFi Based Gesture Recognition Using PyTorch

As I continue to learn and build more projects, I look forward to sharing my progress here. Stay tuned for new projects and feel free to reach out to collaborate or connect!
